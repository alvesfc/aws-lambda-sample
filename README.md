# AWS Lambda Sample
 This repository contains a sample of an AWS Lambda service deployed using Terraform. The sample includes Terraform configuration files and configuration scripts to deploy a Lambda service and configure it for use with the AWS API Gateway. 


## AWS Lambda

AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that runs your code in response to events and automatically manages the compute resources for you. 
You can use it to build applications that respond quickly to new information, and enable you to scale up or down with no administration or configuration. 
With Lambda, you can run code for virtually any type of application or backend service â€“ all with zero administration. 
Lambda automatically runs and scales your code in response to triggers like changes in data, shifts in system state, or actions by users.

## Terraform

Terraform is an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool created by HashiCorp.
It enables developers and system administrators to define, provision, and manage infrastructure using declarative configuration files.
Terraform supports a wide range of cloud providers, as well as custom in-house solutions. It also provides a powerful set of features such as resource orchestration, provisioning automation, and change management.
With Terraform, users can easily create, modify, and version their infrastructure with minimal effort.
